# display from lowest to highest    
# this program will display the numbers from lowest to highest
# using a while loop and sort function

# initialize an empty list to store the numbers
# loop indefinitely until user enters something invalid 
# attempt to convert the input to an integer
# if successful, add the number to the list
# if the input is invalid, break out of the loop
# check if any numbers were entered 
# if so, sort the list in ascending order and display the numbers
